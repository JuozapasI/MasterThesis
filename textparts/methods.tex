\section{Data}

In this thesis following publically available datasets from scRNAseq experiments were used.

\subsection{PBMC}

This dataset is publically available in 10X Genomics website.
In this experiment, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were extracted from fresh whole peripheral blood samples obtained from StemExpress. PBMCs were isolated using SepMate density centrifugation methods.
The library was generated from around 8000 cells (5140 cells recovered) using the Chromium Single Cell 3' v3.1 Reagent Kit,
and sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 to a read depth of approximately 35000 mean reads per cell.
The transcript reads have length of 90bp.
