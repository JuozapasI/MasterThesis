\paragraph{\textbf{Aim}}

The aim of this project is to improve scRNA-seq analysis
by investigating unassigned reads to enhance transcriptomic reference and identify potential new gene candidates.

\paragraph{\textbf{Tasks}}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Identify genomic reagions containing unassigned reads, and classiffy them as either intersecting with genes or intergenic.
  \item Identify reasons why there are unassigned reads in the gene regions, and if possible,
  resolve the transcriptomic reference such that those reads would be assigned to genes.
  \item Identify possible genomic regions containing unannotated genes, based on the unassigned intergenic reads,
  and check if there are any other evidence supporting existance of those genes.
\end{enumerate}
