\paragraph{\textbf{Aim}}

The aim of this project is to investigate whether it is possible to improve scRNA-seq analysis
by including unassigned reads in the downstream analysis.

\paragraph{\textbf{Tasks}}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Identify genomic regions containing unassigned reads, and classiffy them as either intersecting with genes or intergenic.
  \item For intergenic regions, check if there is evidence that would confirm them being noise or unannotated genes.
  \item For intersecting regions, check if it possible to resolve problems related to the transcriptomic reference,
  which lead to reads being unassigned.
\end{enumerate}
